# Bosch-production-line-performance
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict internal failures in Bosch's production lines. By analyzing thousands of measurements and tests conducted on each component, the project aims to enhance the quality control processes and reduce manufacturing costs. The dataset, sourced from a Kaggle competition, presents a challenging problem due to its large number of anonymized features and highly imbalanced nature. Various classification algorithms are tested to determine the most effective method for predicting failures and insights into the production process.
